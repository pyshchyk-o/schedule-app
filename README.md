## Schedule app

---
#### How to run the app:
* In your terminal run:
```
-> npm run install
```
* After modules are installed run:
```
-> npm run start
```
* If for some reason this command will not work, you can start Server and React separately:
```
-> npm run start-server
-> npm run start-js
```
* Open this URL to see the project:
```
-> http://localhost:8080/

## Mock-API:

This is packaged as a standard Node NPM module. To install simply run: `-> npm install` from the project root directory.
Of course Node.JS should be installed beforehand. For Native Developers not familar with NPM here is the [NPM Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

To run the update & run mock-api server execute the command below:

```
-> npm run start
```
You should see the server start on port 1337.
```
Mock service running at http://localhost:1337
```
You can now request data from the mock-api: 
`Try It: http://localhost:1337/epg`
